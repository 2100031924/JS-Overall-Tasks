Topic: JavaScript Variables (var, let, const)
Submission Date: Tomorrow
Instructions:
• Answer all questions clearly
• Mention reason for error-based questions
• Write clean and readable code




SECTION A: Technical Questions


1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
 Ans: var: The "old" way. It is function-scoped, meaning it ignores blocks like if or for. It
can be redeclared and updated anywhere.
let: The "modern" way for variables that will change. it is block-scoped (lives only inside { }).
const: Short for "constant." It is block-scoped and cannot be changed once set.


2) Which keyword allows redeclaration and why?
Ans: The keyword that allows redeclaration is var.
Reason why?
The var keyword allows redeclaration because it is Function Scoped. In the original design
of JavaScript, if declared the same variable twice using var within the same scope, the
JavaScript engine would not throw an error
Example:
var username = "Alice";
var username = "Bob";
console.log(username);
Example 2: Error Code
let price = 50;
let price = 100;
Reason for Error: Modern JavaScript keywords (let and const) are Block Scoped. They
strictly forbid redeclaration in the same scope to help developers avoid accidental bugs
and keep the code predictable.




3)Which keyword allows reinitialization?
Ans: In JavaScript, the keywords that allow reinitialization are var and let.
Reason:
These keywords are designed for variables whose values are expected to change during the
execution of a program .
var and let create "mutable" references.
The JavaScript engine allocates memory that can be updated with a new value at any time.
Example:
// Using let (Modern Best Practice)
let score = 10;
score = 20;
// Reassigned/Reinitialized successfully
console.log(score);
// Output: 20
// Using var
var status = "Pending";
status = "Completed";
// Reassigned successfully
console.log(status);
// Output: Completed
Reason for Error: The const keyword creates a read-only reference. Once a value is
assigned to a const variable, the JavaScript engine locks that memory location, preventing
any further changes to ensure data integrity.





4) Which keyword does not allow redeclaration and reinitialization?
Ans: The keyword that does not allow both redeclaration and reinitialization is const
Example:
const category = "Books";
category = "Music";




5) Why should const be used for fixed values?
Ans: Safety: It prevents accidental changes to important data
 Readability: It tells other programmers that this value will never change.
Example:
const PI = 3.14;






6) What error occurs when redeclaring a let variable?
Ans: SyntaxError: Identifier 'variable_name' has already been declared.
Reason: let is block-scoped and does not allow you to use the same name for a different
variable in the same block. This prevents accidental overwriting of data.
Example:
let user = "John";
let user = "Alex";






7) What error occurs when reassigning a const variable?
Ans: TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
Reason: const creates a read-only reference.
Example:
const speedLimit = 60;
speedLimit = 80;





8) Which keyword is preferred in modern JavaScript and why?
Ans: const is the most preferred, followed by let
Reason: Safety: They prevent bugs caused by variable "leaks".
Predictability: Using const by default makes it clear which values stay the same, making
the code easier to read and debug.





9) Can const be declared without initialization? Explain
Ans: No
Reason: A const variable must be assigned a value at the exact moment it is declared.
Since its value cannot be changed later, declaring it empty would be useless.
Example:
const gravity;






10) When should var be avoided?
Ans: var should be avoided in all modern JavaScript projects
Reason: Scope Issues: var does not respect blocks , which can lead to variables "leaking"
out and causing bugs.
Hoisting Confusion: It initializes as undefined if called early, which can lead to silent errors
that are hard to find compared to the clear errors given by let and const.







SECTION B: Code-Based Questions



11) Predict the output:
var a = 10;
a = 20;
var a = 30;
console.log(a);
Output: 30
Simple Explanation:
var a = 10; declares a variable a and sets it to 10
a = 20; updates (reassigns) the value of a to 20.
var a = 30; redeclares the variable a. Since var allows redeclaration, it simply overwrites the
previous value with 30.
console.log(a); prints the most recent value assigned to a, which is 30.






12) Predict the output:
let b = 5;
b = 15;
console.log(b);
Ans: Output 15
Simple Explanation:
let b = 5; initializes the variable b with a value of 5.
b = 15; reassigns the value of b to 15. Since let allows reassignment, this is a valid
operation.
console.log(b); prints the current value of b, which is now 15.





13) Identify the error:
let x = 10;
let x = 20;
Ans: SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared
Reason: The error occurs because you are trying to redeclare the variable x using the let
keyword in the same scope.
Correct One:
let x = 10;
x = 20;
console.log(x);







14) Identify the error:
const y = 50;
y = 100;
Ans: TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
Correct one:
let y = 50;
y = 100;
console.log(y);






15) Write a program using var to show redeclaration.
Ans: var city = "New York";
var city = "Los Angeles";
// Redeclaring the same variable name
console.log(city);






16) Write a program using let to show reinitialization.
Ans: let score = 50;
score = 100;
// Changing the value
console.log(score);






17) Write a program using const and explain why value cannot change.
Ans: const birthYear = 1995;
// birthYear = 2000;
// This would cause a TypeError
console.log(birthYear);
Reason: The value cannot change because const creates a read-only reference.






18) Convert var to let where applicable.
Ans: A loop counter or a value that changes.
Before (var): var counter = 1;
After (let): let counter = 1;





19) Convert var to const where applicable.
Ans: A fixed value like a mathematical constant.
Before (var): var pi = 3.14;
After (const): const PI = 3.14;





20) Write your own example for var, let, and const.
Ans: // var
var trainer = "John";
// let
currentStep = 5;
currentStep = 6;
// const
const API_KEY = "ABC123XYZ";
console.log(trainer, currentStep, API_KEY);
